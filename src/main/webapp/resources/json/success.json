  "failureMessage": "Luck is not on your side today. As soon as You sailed away from the shore, you were spotted by the royal falcons. The guards of Edenia intercepted You. Although you resisted with all your might, it was in vain. You were taken to the sorting station. Your further fate is unknown. God bless You, Traveler. What can I add here... \"We do not drive people with sticks...\" - King of Edenia"
